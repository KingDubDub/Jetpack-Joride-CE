# Jetpack-Joride-CE
Hey there! Before you keep reading, here's some questions:
1. Do like games?
2. Do you like math?
3. Do you like playing games instead of doing math like a responisble person?

If you answered "Yes" to any of those, then you should keep reading.

This is a port by King Dub Dub of the popular smartphone game "Jetpack Joyride" by Halfbrick Studios, but it's on a TI-Plus CE calculator.

Software Installation Instructions:

1. Make sure you've installed the TI-Connect software from the Texas Instruments site.
2. Make sure your calculator OS is below 5.5-5.6, since the program can't be run on those OS's or any that disable C/Assembly programs.
    -If your OS is 5.5 or higher, use the arTIfiCE exploit tool to run the program: https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/
3. Send the JETPACK.8xp program from /bin to the calculator
4. When prompted, save the program to the Archive, if you put it in the RAM it will disappear if your battery dies or the RAM resets.
5. On the calc, press "prgm" and select JETPACK.
6. Brag to your freinds that you're a "l337 h4x0r"

Controls:
-Hold "2nd" to rise, release to fall
-Press "clear" to exit the game

NOTES FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUILD FROM SOURCE:
-The convimg.yaml is written for Mateo's convimg utility version 8.3 and up, it will give an output error if you use a lower version.

REMEMBER:
1. I am not to blame for any damage caused to your calc by the program, as it's still in its testing phases.
2. I am not to blame for any damage caused to your corpse/body by your inattention during chemisty; play responsibly when it's safe, not when you're     handling fulminates!
3. I don't claim to own the rights to the origianl Jetpack Joyride, this is just a bit of fun for the users and a learning experience for me.

I hope you enjoy spreading a little madness, and remember never to trust someone with more than four bumper stickers on their car, they're clearly insane.

Have a nice mid-to-late afternoon!
